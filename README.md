# THIS PROJECT IS UNFINISHED. I AM VERY FAR BEHIND ON THE COURSE BUT I HAVE TO SUBMIT SOMETHING BY THE DEADLINE DATE TO AVOID HEFTY LATE SUBMISSION FEES. PLEASE ACCEPT MY APOLOGIES FOR WASTING YOUR TIME TRYING TO ASSESS THIS.

# PP5 - Vape City

Vape City is an e-commerce site that allows users to order vaping products and paraphernalia as a one off purchase and also subscribe to receive products on a regular basis with a discount for subscribing. As an avid vaper I struggle to find vaping e-commerce platforms with good UX and subscription models that are reliable. This is a problem in the vaping industry as retail vaping products are generally supplied by very small businesses that cannot afford good developers. They also cannot use popular self-build platforms such as Shopify as most ban the setup of vape shops due to the lack of regulation in the vaping space. My goal with this site is to use the skills and knowledge I have learning throughout this course to solve this real-world problem with an e-commerce site that could become a trusted brand with good UX and a reliable subscription model.

# Planning

I started this project by setting up a project in GitHub and using agile methodologies to define user stories that would guide me in the development of site. This allowed me to develop the site in small sprints by focusing on one user story at a time. The goal with using this agile methodology was to prevent me becoming overwhelmed with several developments at once. In the past I have tended to flip between front-end UX and back-end application and get lost or overwhelmed trying to code too many things at once.
